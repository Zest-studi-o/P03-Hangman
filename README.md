## Credits

### Code Used

- [Invent it with Python tutorial](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter8.html) - I used this tutorial to help me with understanding how to create a basic hangman game to build upon it using Python.

- I used other student examples as a reference to understand how to build my own game and what is expected for the app and readme.md, [Hangaman 1](https://github.com/PedroCristo/portfolio_project_3), [Hangaman 2](https://github.com/one1189/hangman) those projects were also helpful to find resources that helped me build the game, such as the use of ASCII Art, Lucid Chart, Colorama or reference material.

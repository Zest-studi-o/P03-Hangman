## User Experience (UX)

#### Key information for the site

This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who this game is for, the main aims of the project and how it can help users meet their needs.

Project goals:

- To encourage people to play the hangman game.

- To provide an easy and user-friendly command line game.

### User Stories

#### First-Time Visitor Goals

- As a first-time visitor, I want to start a new game using the comand line.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to see how many attempts I have left when playing.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to see the words I guessed so far displayed.
- As a first-time visitor, I want the app to ask me if I want to play again or not when finishing.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor, I want to see my results.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

- As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to play the game using different categories.

### Features

#### Existing Features

Features here

**Feature A**

![Feature A image]()

- This does abc.

**Category selection**

![Category selection image]()

- When the user selects to start the game, the terminal displays options to select between different word categories grouped by themes.

**Score counter**

![Score counter image]()

- This counts the score obtained by the player, adds 25 per letter guessed and 200 if the player guesses the word in full, it displays this data to the terminal for user feedback.
---

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to:

- Refine the score counter so it would add more points the earlier the full word is guessed.

- Add colours to the terminal.

- Add a feature in which the user can select words sorted by length.

- Add a multiplayer feature.

### Code Used

- [How to build HANGMAN with Python in 10 MINUTES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4nEnsavl6w) - I used this tutorial to help me with understanding how to create a basic hangman game to build upon it using Python.

- I used other student examples as a reference to understand how to build my own game and what is expected for the app and readme.md, [Hangaman 1](https://github.com/PedroCristo/portfolio_project_3), [Hangaman 2](https://github.com/one1189/hangman) those projects were also helpful to find resources that helped me build the game, such as the use of ASCII Art, Lucid Chart, Colorama or reference material.
